Stay positive and think that your always open to bring  changes to your life, which will obviously take time but at least you'll try. Do experiments and start setting small goals.

 We think that we're always correct but that is not the case most of the time and that's not ego that's human nature. Its okay if you find something in your personality which is not suitable for your relationships and work, try to change or amend it. Fight with it and try to win. Instead of ruining your relationships and do compromises with your work, just flush out that defective part from your personality. That's how changes makes our lives better and smooth. Faster we bring changes, fast we grow!!
